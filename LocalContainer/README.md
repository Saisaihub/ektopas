# Local Container Setup for Monte Carlo Simulation

This guide will walk you through setting up a Docker container with the latest Ubuntu image and Topas 3.9 for your Monte Carlo simulations. 

Firstly, you need to [create an image](creatAnTopasImage.md), this is the mother of all container instances to be run in the future

Then, you can run your simulation with simple steps by following [Run simulation locally](runSimilulationLocally.md).
