# Containerised TOPAS Simulation

This repository contains the setup instructions and information on running simulations using containerized Topas 3.9 on the latest Ubuntu image in both a local host machine and an Azure environment.

I suggest trying the Topas container on your local PC first. If you like it, then proceed to the next section.

## Local Topas Container 

For running the simulation locally, you can use Docker to containerize Topas 3.9 with the latest Ubuntu image. Detailed instructions can be found in [LocalContainer](LocalContainer).

## Azure Topas Container (in-progress)

To build an infrastructure on Azure for more scalable simulations, follow the setup guide in [AzureContainer](./AzureContainer). This section will guide you through the process of deploying and managing simulations in an Azure container environment.

## Useful Links

Here are two useful links for your reference:

- [Topas Download Page](https://www.topasmc.org/download): You can download the Topas simulation software from this link.

- [Geant4 Dataset Page](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/download/11.1.2.html): Access the Geant4 dataset required for your Monte Carlo simulations.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance with this Monte Carlo simulation infrastructure project.
