# Monte Carlo Simulation Infrastructure with Azure Containers

Welcome to the Monte Carlo Simulation Infrastructure project utilizing Azure Containers. This repository contains the setup instructions and information on running simulations using containerized Topas 3.9 on the latest Ubuntu image in an Azure environment.

## Local Container Setup

For running the simulation locally, you can use Docker to containerize Topas 3.9 with the latest Ubuntu image. Detailed instructions can be found in [LocalContainer/containerSetup.md](LocalContainer).

## Azure Container Setup (in-progress)

To build an infrastructure on Azure for more scalable simulations, follow the setup guide in [AzureContainer](./AzureContainer). This section will guide you through the process of deploying and managing simulations in an Azure container environment.

## Useful Links

Here are two useful links for your reference:
